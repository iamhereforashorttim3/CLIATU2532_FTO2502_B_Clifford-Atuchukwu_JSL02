# JSL02 Challenge

## Overview:
The task was to create an entry system in Javascript where the user is required to enter Task names,
descriptions and the status of the two tasks. The details of the entry system are meant to be stored and 
displayed within the console.

### How to run it:
1. Download the javascript.js, index.html and styles.css files. Optional: Download the assets files
2. Place them inside of a folder within your file manager and run the file in Visual Studio Code
3. If you have the Live Server extension downloaded, click the icon on the bottom right corner
of the screen to see the webpage.
4. Add the inputs, inspect element and go to the console

## Initial thoughts/Struggles:
* I came into the project relatively confident, because I have done similar projects in the past with the use of Python.
* A thing that threw me off was knowing where to start, but after placing the first lines of code everything began to run smoothly
* An issue that I had was deciding on whether I should create an entirely seperate section for the second task, but ultimately using 
a for loop was the right call to make.

## Technologies used:
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
